Print layer-0 trained weights for yolo-v3-tiny : darknet print cfg/yolov3-tiny.cfg darknet53.conv.74 0

For layer-0, the filter size is 3x3 and an input image has 3 channels, so actually a filter will be trained three times for each channel, ie. each filter vector has dimension of 3x3x3=27;
             and 16 filters are trained, this is why we see 16 rows printed.
For layer-2, each filter vector has dimension of 3x3x16, and there are 32 filters.
For layer-4, each filter vector has dimension of 3x3x32, and there are 64 filters.
For layer-6, each filter vector has dimension of 3x3x64, and there are 128 filters.
