Process for training a model to compare two images  (Last update: 2019/04/15)
1. Train a detection model
2. Perform pseudo-labeling with the trained model
   Use scripts/pseudo_label.py to derive more training data
3. Use scripts/crop.py to extract objects (from label files) as image files
   (To do) Data augmentation to derive more training data
4. (To do) Prepare dataset for training compare.c
   Input is two images merged side by side into one image.
   Positive: Same object (Two similar images)
   Negative: Two unmatched images
5. (To do) Training comppare.c
